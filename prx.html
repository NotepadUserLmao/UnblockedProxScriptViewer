The Spanish, aided by indigenous allies, overthrew the Aztecs and claimed Mexico for Spain. This marked the beginning of Spanish rule in the Americas, leading to significant cultural and demographic changes.</p><p>The conquest was facilitated by European diseases such as smallpox, which devastated the indigenous population. Additionally, the Spanish imposed their language, religion, and social systems, leading to the erasure of many native traditions. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán, was destroyed and rebuilt as Mexico City, becoming the center of Spanish colonial rule in the New World.</p><p>The Spanish exploitation of indigenous labor through the encomienda system resulted in widespread suffering and depopulation. However, some aspects of Aztec culture persisted, blending with Spanish influences to create modern Mexican identity.</p><p>Despite the initial destruction, many elements of Aztec culture, such as their culinary traditions, architectural techniques, and artistic expressions, have survived and influenced contemporary Mexican society.</p></div><div id="toggleBox"></div><script>let isOnHistoryPage=false;document.getElementById('toggleBox').addEventListener('click',function(){const frame=document.getElementById('proxyFrame');const historyText=document.getElementById('historyText');if(!isOnHistoryPage){frame.style.display='none';historyText.style.display='block';}else{frame.style.display='block';historyText.style.display='none';}isOnHistoryPage=!isOnHistoryPage});</script></body></html>
